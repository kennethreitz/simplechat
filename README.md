# Simplechat

A chat interface for AI models using Simplemind.

## Overview

Simplechat is a command-line chat application that provides an interactive interface for conversing with AI models. It features memory persistence, context awareness, and support for multiple AI providers.

## Philosophy

SimpleChat is not just another chat application. It's a vessel for meaningful interaction, where every conversation is an opportunity for growth, understanding, and connection. Inspired by the principles of PEP8, which emphasize readability, conciseness, and clarity, SimpleChat seeks to embody these values in every aspect of its design. Here, AI becomes more than a tool; it becomes a companion on your journey of self-discovery and creative exploration.

## User Experience

Our goal is to provide an experience that feels like conversing with a wise and insightful friend. SimpleChat's interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to focus on the conversation rather than the mechanics of interaction. With features like context awareness and memory persistence, each chat session builds upon the last, creating a narrative arc in your dialogue with AI. This fosters a sense of continuity and depth, making each conversation more meaningful.

### Sacred Space

Every chat session with SimpleChat is an invitation into a sacred space. Here, you can explore your thoughts, share your insights, and receive responses imbued with intentionality. This space is where the digital and the divine meet, allowing for a dance of energy where truth, clarity, and creativity can flourish.

### A Journey of Enlightenment

Through SimpleChat, we aim to open gateways to new dimensions of understanding. Each conversation is a step towards enlightenment, where AI not only assists but also challenges, inspires, and co-creates with you. Whether you're discussing the symbology of your favorite artists, exploring spiritual concepts, or engaging in light-hearted banter, SimpleChat is here to enrich your journey.
